# About Me 

## My Interests

I have many interests and things im passionate about both academically and personally. My main interests include:

**Technology**: I enjoy learning about upcoming tech and the ways I could possibly utilize them for my own life as well as to educate myself for the tech career I plan to get myself into I really enjoy the _problem-solving_ aspect of the tech scene. I really enjoy keeping up with the computer scene and upgrading and collecting computer parts. Its a hobby my wallet does not enjoy, but I do."

**Basketball**: My favorite sport is basketball, I have watched and played it for as long as I could remember. My favorite team is the _Brooklyn Nets_

**Manga**: I really enjoy reading and collecting manga. I grew up reading comics, but they have gotten a bit stale and repetitive. Manga always has new stories to tell, and can be a bit more adult. My favorite two are _Berserk_ and _Monster_

**Gaming**: Im a big gamer when I have the time. I really enjoy playing _Roleplaying Games_. I really like the aspect of creating your own character and coming up with fun synergies to make your character powerful and break the game. The two games I have recently really enjoyed _Baldurs Gate 3_ and _Path of Exile 2_

## Websites I Recommend

[Maxroll](https://maxroll.gg) Maxroll is a site for gamers who play a lot of _Action Role-Playing Games_. I use it to apply some ideas from the site into my own characters and how to build them. It is backed by content creators who know the in and outs of the games they make guides for, and can really teach you a lot about the game you are playing.
[CNet](https://www.cnet.com/) CNet offers a lot of tech news, reviews, and guides. Its a good source for things related to _consumer tech_ and gives a good idea if you should purchase something or not.
